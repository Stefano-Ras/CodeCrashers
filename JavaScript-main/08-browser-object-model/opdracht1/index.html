				<h1>Final Fantasy</h1>
				<p>Final Fantasy, also known as Final Fantasy I or the Original Final Fantasy in collections and common languages, is a role-playing game developed and published by Square Co., Ltd. for the Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan in December 1987, and the first title in Square's flagship Final Fantasy series. The game was later released in North America in 1990, and has since been re-released worldwide on the PlayStation, the Game Boy Advance, the PlayStation Portable, iOS, Android, and many other platforms, with re-releases making modifications and adding new content. The game was directed by Hironobu Sakaguchi, with Nobuo Uematsu composing the score (as his sixteenth work of video game music composition).</p>
				<p>The game puts players in control of four characters known as the Warriors of Light, and begins by asking the player to select the classes and names of each. The Warriors of Light can traverse the maps of dungeons and towns, which are connected by a world map, and will run into random encounters with enemies or fight bosses. Battles are controlled using menus in a turn-based fashion, in which characters can use attacks and Magic, depending on the class they have equipped.</p>
				<p>Final Fantasy takes place in a fantasy medieval setting with three major continents, and the four Warriors of Light begin in Cornelia. They are tasked by the King of Cornelia to rescue Princess Sarah from Garland, and after defeating him, the king opens up a bridge enabling them to pass to the town of Pravoka. This sets them off on an adventure to defeat the Four Fiends and rescue the world.</p>

				<h1>Final Fantasy II</h1>
				<p>Final Fantasy II is the second installment in the Final Fantasy series, developed and published by Squaresoft. It was released in December 1988 for the Nintendo Entertainment System exclusively in Japan, but was later re-released worldwide for the PlayStation, the Game Boy Advance, the PlayStation Portable, iOS, Android, and other platforms. It was directed by Hironobu Sakaguchi, with Yoshitaka Amano designing the characters and Nobuo Uematsu composing the score. It was notable for being one of the first story-intensive RPGs released for console systems, and introducing many series staples, including chocobos and a character named Cid. Its story is unrelated to the original Final Fantasy, and its gameplay is a major departure from the previous title for eliminating the traditional experience-based progression system.</p>
				<p>The game centers on a conflict by the Palamecian Empire, whose Emperor Mateus is using hellspawn to try to conquer the world. The protagonist, Firion, along with his allies Maria and Guy, join the Wild Rose Rebellion to fight them, and meet many allies along the way to try to stop the Emperor and save the world.</p>
				<p>Final Fantasy II eliminates the leveling system from the previous game, focusing on the playable characters' stats, which increase according to how much they are used or required; for example, a character who frequently casts Magic would have their magic proficiency increase faster, while a character who frequently takes damage would have their maximum HP increase. Battles are fought in the turn-based system seen in the previous game, though each character has their class and abilities defined.</p>

				<h1>Final Fantasy III</h1>
				<p>Final Fantasy III is the third installment in the Final Fantasy series, developed and published by Squaresoft. It was released in April 1990 for the Nintendo Entertainment System exclusively in Japan. It was later remade in 3D by Matrix Software and released worldwide for the Nintendo DS, with this version re-released for iOS, Android, the PlayStation Portable, Microsoft Windows, and other platforms. It was directed by Hironobu Sakaguchi, with Nobuo Uematsu composing the score and Yoshitaka Amano providing the image design. The original version was not released outside of Japan, introduced the earliest form of the job system, which has since become something of a Final Fantasy staple.</p>
				<p>The story revolves around four Warriors of Light who begin as Onion Knights in the original release, although they are named Luneth, Arc, Refia and Ingus in the 3D remake. When they find the Wind Crystal, it grants them its power, and instructs them to restore balance to the world.</p>
				<p>Final Fantasy III introduces the job system, in which the four characters can equip one of twenty-three jobs, earned by finding crystals or completing sidequests. Jobs jobs grant the player characters abilities, such as Magic, and some special commands associated with specific jobs, such as Steal associated with the Thief and Jump associated with the Dragoon. Using a job for longer increases the characters' stats.</p>

				<h1>Final Fantasy IV</h1>
				<p>Final Fantasy IV is the fourth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, developed and published by Squaresoft. It was released in July 1991 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan, and released as Final Fantasy II in North America in October 1991 (with alterations made due to Nintendo of America's guidelines at the time). It has subsequently been re-released worldwide as Final Fantasy IV for the PlayStation, Game Boy Advance and other platforms, as well as a re-release on PlayStation Portable as part of a collection with its two sequels. A three-dimensional remake, developed by Matrix Software and published by Square Enix, was released for the Nintendo DS, iOS, Android and Steam platforms. The game was directed by Hironobu Sakaguchi, with Yoshitaka Amano providing the character designs and Nobuo Uematsu composing the score. It was the first title developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the second overall released in North America, and the first to introduce the series' iconic Active Time Battle system.</p>
				<p>The game takes place in a medieval fantasy setting, and focuses on Cecil Harvey, the captain of the Red Wings of Baron. After performing a raid on Mysidia to steal the Water Crystal, Cecil and the knights question the orders of their king as they believed stealing from the Mysidians was wrong. As punishment for disloyalty, the king strips Cecil of his title, and orders him and Kain Highwind to win back his trust by sending him to the village of Mist. This sets Cecil off on an adventure in which he and many other allies he meets must uncover the truth and save the world from monsters.</p>
				<p>Final Fantasy IV is the first game to use the Active Time Battle system, in which characters' moves are represented by a gauge and they can perform an action when the gauge is full. A party consists of up to five characters, each with two unique abilities. Characters unlock new abilities and improve their stats as they level up. In the 3D versions, additional customization is available in the form of Augments, that allow characters to use different abilities.</p>
				<p>A sequel, Final Fantasy IV: The After Years, was released for Japanese mobile phones in February 2008. The sequel was released via WiiWare in the US on June 1, 2009, and is included in Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection for the PlayStation Portable, along with a "midquel" titled Final Fantasy IV -Interlude-. </p>

				<h1>Final Fantasy V</h1>
				<p>Final Fantasy V is the fifth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, developed and published by Squaresoft. It was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan in 1992, and has since been re-released in Japan and in the west on PlayStation in 1998, on Game Boy Advance in 2006, on iOS and Android in 2013, and on Microsoft Windows via Steam in 2015. It was directed by Hironobu Sakaguchi, with Yoshitaka Amano providing the character design and Nobuo Uematsu composing the score. It was the only installment on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System that was not released outside of Japan, with Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy VI both releasing in North America titled Final Fantasy II and Final Fantasy III, respectively. It was the first Final Fantasy to use kanji in text as well as hiragana and katakana.</p>
				<p>The game takes place in a medieval fantasy setting, and centers on a group of four strangers brought together by circumstance to save the Crystals that have mysteriously begun shattering. The one behind the phenomenon is the antagonist Exdeath, as part of a plan to release himself from imprisonment and gain the power of the Void, a realm of nothingness, which could bestow absolute power on one able to resist being absorbed by it. The four become the Warriors of Light and turn their attentions to defeating Exdeath and stopping the Void's energies from consuming their world.</p>
				<p>The key feature of Final Fantasy V is the job system, which allows each of the four characters to switch to one of twenty-two jobs, and master the jobs to retain their abilities and stats when using a different job. The four can use the abilities of their current job and any mastered abilities they have equipped from other jobs. Battles are fought using the Active Time Battle system. Much of the strategy revolves around mixing up combinations of jobs, or learning the right skills from a job to use in combination with skills from another job, to defeat challenging dungeons and bosses.</p>
				<p>Final Fantasy V has had a great influence on the series. The job system has inspired later games, including Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy X-2. It also introduced many conventions to the series, such as the Blue Mage, and the recurring mini-boss in the form of Gilgamesh, who himself has featured in many games since. The anime, Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals, is an OVA sequel to Final Fantasy V taking place two hundred years after the game's events. </p>

				<h1>Final Fantasy VI</h1>
				<p>Final Fantasy VI is the sixth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, developed and published by Squaresoft. It was released in April 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan, and released as Final Fantasy III in North America in October 1994 (with alterations made due to Nintendo of America's guidelines at the time). Later, it was re-released worldwide as Final Fantasy VI for the PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, iOS, Android, and Microsoft Windows platforms, with re-releases making changes including modified graphics and additional content. It was co-directed by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Itou, taking over from Hironobu Sakaguchi, with Nobuo Uematsu composing the score and Yoshitaka Amano providing image design. It was the final title in the series to feature two-dimensional graphics, and the first story that did not revolve around crystals.</p>
				<p>Final Fantasy VI focuses on a conflict between the Gestahlian Empire conquering the world and a rebel faction opposed to them known as the Returners, taking place in a fantasy steampunk-style world. The Empire has acquired a great army through experiments with espers, magical demi-gods of legend. The Returners seek magical power to fight the Empire on equal terms, and an amnesiac former imperial soldier, Terra Branford, proves key to both sides for understanding magic and espers.</p>
				<p>The game gives players up to fourteen playable characters, the largest cast in the series, and features the Active Time Battle pseudo-turn based menu command system. A party can consist of up to four characters, though some events require the player to assemble three different parties of up to four and switch between them. Each character has a unique command ability, such as Terra's Trance, Locke's Steal, Edgar's Tools or Sabin's Blitz, and can also learn Magic spells from earning AP from battles with magicite equipped. Each character's rare Desperation Attack will randomly activate after using the Attack command when at critical health.</p>
				<p>Final Fantasy VI released with widespread critical acclaim with 93.96% on GameRankings. It has retained critical acclaim in re-releases, with a 97% GameRankings score for PlayStation, and Metacritic scores of 92/100 and 91/100 for Game Boy Advance and iOS respectively. It has been seen as one of the defining games for its console, genre and for the series as a whole, praised for its gameplay, characters, musical score, and the darker and more engaging story when compared with previous entries. The Super Nintendo and PlayStation versions combined have sold 3.48 million copies (with 2.62 million from Japan and the remaining 860,000 abroad). It has a more enduring popularity among fans in the west than in Japan.</p>
